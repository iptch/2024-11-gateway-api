# Overview

<!--

I would structure the talk as follows:

1. Ingress vs Gateway API
   - what is an ingress
   - what are the current use cases / shortcomings
   - what is gateway api
   - how does it address the above shortcomings
   - what about RHOS routes?
2. Our setup
   - describe what we built (diagram)
   - how do we provision it? (TF and flux explanation)
   - how close is it to a productive environment?
   - what is missing?
   (this section might already contain diving hands-on in the setup to show some stuff)
3. Demos
   - set of demos we have to showcase the capabilities of gateway api

-->

# Gateway vs Ingress

- more flexible
- support for more protocols
- supports extensions
- supports resource isolation (layered approach)
- more advanced routing (rate limiting, etc)
- strong support for multi-tenancy
